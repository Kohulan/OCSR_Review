# Optical Chemical Structure Recognition - Benchmark

- This repository contains the information related to the benchmark study on openly available OCSR tools

## Materials and methods

- In order to compare the results of the three available open-source OCSR tools Imago (version 2.0) (1), Molvec (version 0.9.7) (2) and OSRA (version 2.1.0) (3), multiple datasets which are freely available online were analyzed analogously to the validation procedure by the OSRA developers (4):

  - A set of 5719 images of chemical structures and the corresponding mol-files (based on data by the US Patent Office (USPTO)) was obtained from the OSRA online presence (4). 

  - Along with the publication of Molrec (5) which was developed by the University of Birmingham (UOB), a dataset of 5740 images of chemical structures with the corresponding mol files was published (6). 

  - The Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) published a test set of 961 images and mol files in 2012 (7).

  - A subset (450 images and SD files) of a dataset published with ChemInfty (8) which is based on data from the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) was obtained from the OSRA online presence (4). It is necessary to state that this dataset contains many labels (sometimes with japanese characters) and irregular features (like variations in the line thickness). Additionally, some images have a poor quality and contain a lot of noise.

- The TIFF images were converted to PNG images with a resolution of 72 dpi to assure comparability as MolVec and Imago both showed problems handling those files in batch mode. 

- Converted Images can be found on the [input]() directory

### Running Imago
- Command line version of Imago (9) was used here.
```
./imago_console -dir /image/directory/path
```

### Running MolVec with parallelization
```
java -cp molvec-0.9.7.jar:common-image-3.4.1.jar:common-io-3.4.1.jar:common-lang-3.4.1.jar:commons-cli-1.4.jar:imageio-core-3.4.1.jar:imageio-metadata-3.4.1.jar:imageio-tiff-3.4.1.jar:ncats-common-0.3.3.jar:ncats-common-cli-0.9.1.jar gov.nih.ncats.molvec.Main -dir /image/directory/path -parallel 30 -outDir /output/directory/path
```

### Running OSRA

- OSRA was installed in an Anaconda environment using the Conda recipe for PyOSRA which was published by Ed Beard (10). This was done analogously to the installation instructions in the ChemSchematicResover documentation (11). We use the PyOSRA environment because compiling OSRA from source code is excessively complex as it has a lot of dependencies that need to be compiled from their own source code as well. There is the option to obtain a commercial license to get a precompiled version of the software.

```
for image in *.png; do osra -f sdf -a /path/to/superatom/dictionary/superatom.txt -l /path/to/spelling/corrections/dictionary/spelling.txt -w /output/path/$image.sdf $image;done
```

### Results

- Time elapsed and accuracy reported for the open-source OCSR tools
 
  - The accuracies of the tools listed in Table above correspond to perfectly-recognized structures according to a perfect match of the Standard InChI strings (12) that were created based on the OCSR results and the reference files.

Dataset | | MolVec 0.9.7 | Imago 2.0 | OSRA 2.1
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
USPTO | Time (min) | 4.52 | 72.83 | 145.04
*(5719 images)* | Accuracy | 88.37% | 87.20% | 87.69%
 UOB | Time (min) | 3.13 | 152.52 | 125.78
 *(5740 images)* | Accuracy | 88.07% | 63.54% | 86.50%
CLEF 2012 | Time (min) | 0.59 | 16.03 | 21.33
*(961 images)* | Accuracy | 80.54% | 65.45% | 94.90%
JPO | Time (min) | 1.03 | 22.55 | 16.68
*(450 images)* | Accuracy | 66.67% | 40.00% | 57.78%

- (a) Accuracy (Right: higher the better) and (b) Total time for processing (Left: lower the better)

#### Conclusion

- MolVec is the fastest tool due to its possibility of parallelization. It is necessary to state that without the parallelization, MolVec would not be faster than Imago or OSRA. All three tools performed fairly well on the given set of images. As shown in Figure 1, the proportion of accurate results produced by MolVec and OSRA with the UOB, CLEF, and JPO datasets was approximately 20% higher than in the results produced by Imago. The lower overall performance of all three tools with the JPO dataset is likely due to the lower quality of the depictions, the presence of labels, and other irregular features.
