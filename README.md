# Optical Chemical Structure Recognition - Benchmark

- This repository contains the information related to the benchmark study on openly available OCSR tools

## Materials and methods

- In order to compare the results of the three available open-source OCSR tools Imago (version 2.0), MolVec (version 0.9.7) and OSRA (version 2.1.0), multiple datasets which are freely available online were analyzed according to the validation procedure of the OSRA developers (4). The datasets were::

  - A set of 5719 images of chemical structures and the corresponding molfiles (based on data from the USPTO) obtained from the OSRA online presence (4). 

  - The dataset (UOB) of 5740 images and molfiles of chemical structures developed by the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom, and published alongside MolRec  (6). 

  - The Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) test set of 961 images and molfiles published in 2012 (7).

  - A subset (450 images and SDfiles) of a dataset published with ChemInfty (see above) based on data from the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), obtained from the OSRA online presence (4). (Note that this dataset contains many labels (sometimes with Japanese characters) and irregular features, such as variations in the line thickness. Additionally, some images have a poor quality and contain a lot of noise.) 

- The TIFF images were converted to PNG images with a resolution of 72 dpi to assure comparability, as MolVec and Imago both showed problems handling those TIFF files in batch mode.

- Converted Images can be found on the [input](https://github.com/Kohulan/OCSR_Review/tree/master/assets/images) directory

### Running Imago
- Command line version of Imago (9) was used here.
```
./imago_console -dir /image/directory/path
```

### Running MolVec with parallelization
```
java -cp molvec-0.9.7.jar:common-image-3.4.1.jar:common-io-3.4.1.jar:common-lang-3.4.1.jar:commons-cli-1.4.jar:imageio-core-3.4.1.jar:imageio-metadata-3.4.1.jar:imageio-tiff-3.4.1.jar:ncats-common-0.3.3.jar:ncats-common-cli-0.9.1.jar gov.nih.ncats.molvec.Main -dir /image/directory/path -outDir /output/directory/path
```

### Running OSRA

- OSRA was installed in an Anaconda environment using the Conda recipe for PyOSRA which was published by Ed Beard (10). This was done analogously to the installation instructions in the ChemSchematicResover documentation (11). We use the PyOSRA environment because compiling OSRA from source code is excessively complex as it has a lot of dependencies that need to be compiled from their own source code as well. There is the option to obtain a commercial license to get a precompiled version of the software.

```
for image in *.png; do osra -f sdf -a /path/to/superatom/dictionary/superatom.txt -l /path/to/spelling/corrections/dictionary/spelling.txt -w /output/path/$image.sdf $image;done
```

### Results

- Time elapsed and accuracy reported for the open-source OCSR tools
 
  - The accuracies of the tools listed in Table above correspond to perfectly-recognized structures according to a perfect match of the Standard InChI strings (12) that were created based on the OCSR results and the reference files.

#### Conclusion

- As shown in the Table, MolVec processes the images significantly faster than its competitors. All three tools performed fairly well on the given set of images. As illustrated in Figure 1, the proportion of accurate results produced by MolVec and OSRA with the UOB, CLEF and JPO datasets was approximately 20% higher than in the results produced by Imago. The lower overall performance of all three tools with the JPO dataset is likely due to the lower quality of the depictions, the presence of labels and other irregular features. The extraordinarily good performance of OSRA on the CLEF dataset is a notable observation. The examination of the images in the dataset reveals a set of well-segmented, clean chemical structure depictions which is seemingly handled especially well by OSRA.
